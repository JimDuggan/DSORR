# DSORR
Data Science for Operational Researchers using R. 

R is a powerful data analysis technology that is widely used to support decision making and analytics.
In recent years, R has been significantly enhanced as a practical data science technology through the
development of the “tidyverse” libraries, which provide excellent support for generating, and
communicating, insights from data. R can also be used to support analysis of simulation output, in
particular, the supporting sensitivity analysis.

The course is designed to support operational research practitioners who support data-driven decision making
within their organisation, and are interested in exploring new tools, workflows and methods to
generate insights, and communicate these to key stakeholders.

Participants should setup an account on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud), and then download this github site when setting up a project.

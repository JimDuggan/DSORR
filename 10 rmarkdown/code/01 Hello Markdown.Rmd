This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

The data give the speed (*mph*) of cars and the distances (feet) taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s.

Below is a code chunk.


```{r}
fit <- lm(dist~speed,data=cars)
b <- coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression line is `r b[2]`.
